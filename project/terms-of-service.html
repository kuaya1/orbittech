                <p>We provide professional installation services for customer-owned Starlink and Amazon Kuiper satellite internet systems. A standard installation includes the secure mounting of the satellite dish at an agreed-upon location, routing of the cable from the dish to the interior of the property, connection to the modem/router, and verification of a successful system connection.</p>
                <p>Services do NOT include network configuration beyond the basic satellite internet setup, electrical work, trenching, tree removal, or moving of furniture. Any work required beyond the scope of a standard installation will be discussed with the customer and may incur additional charges.</p>

                <p>To ensure a safe and efficient installation, you agree to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate and complete address and contact information.</li>
                    <li>Ensure an adult (18 years or older) with the authority to make decisions is present for the entire duration of the installation appointment.</li>
                    <li>Provide our technicians with safe and clear access to all necessary areas of the property, including roofs, attics, and crawl spaces.</li>
                    <li>Inform us of any known hazards, such as asbestos, faulty wiring, or structural issues, prior to the appointment.</li>
                    <li>Obtain any necessary permissions from landlords, property owners, or Homeowners' Associations (HOA) prior to the installation. We are not responsible for any violations of HOA rules or lease agreements.</li>

                <p>Payment for services is due in full upon completion of the installation. We accept the following payment methods: <strong>Credit Card, Check, Zelle, and Cash</strong>.</p>
                <p>An estimate of costs will be provided prior to the service. The final invoice will reflect the actual services performed. Any changes to the scope of work must be agreed upon in writing (e.g., via text or email) before work commences and may affect the final price.</p>

                <p>We understand that schedules can change. We require a minimum of <strong>24</strong> hours' notice for any cancellation or rescheduling of an appointment. </p>
                <p>Cancellations made with less than <strong>24</strong> hours' notice, or if our technician arrives and is unable to perform the work due to a failure to meet User Responsibilities (e.g., no adult present, unsafe access), may be subject to a cancellation fee of <strong>$75.00</strong> to cover travel and scheduling costs.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to reschedule an appointment due to severe weather conditions or other circumstances beyond our control. We will make every effort to provide as much notice as possible.</p>

                <p>While we take the utmost care during installation, we are not responsible for pre-existing damage to your property. We will document and photograph the work area before and after our service. Any damage caused by our direct negligence will be addressed as covered by our business liability insurance.</p>
