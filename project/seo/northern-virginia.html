            <h2>Northern Virginia Starlink Installation FAQs</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does Starlink perform in Northern Virginia compared to Fios or Cox?</h3>
                <p>Starlink offers significant speed improvements over DSL and older satellite options, especially in rural parts of Loudoun and Prince William counties. In areas with Fios or Cox availability, Starlink typically offers comparable download speeds (50-250 Mbps) but may have higher latency. It's an excellent primary option where cable/fiber isn't available, or a strong backup internet solution throughout NOVA.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can Starlink be installed in Northern Virginia neighborhoods with strict HOAs?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we have extensive experience working with HOAs throughout Northern Virginia. While the FCC OTARD rule generally protects your right to install satellite dishes, we strive to find mounting solutions that satisfy both technical requirements and aesthetic concerns. Our installations in communities like Reston, Ashburn, and Burke have successfully navigated HOA requirements while delivering excellent Starlink performance.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What's your service response time in Northern Virginia?</h3>
                <p>As a local Northern Virginia company based in Vienna, we typically offer same-week appointments throughout Fairfax, Arlington, Alexandria, Loudoun, and Prince William counties. Many installations can be scheduled within 2-3 days of your initial contact.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do you offer Starlink installation for Northern Virginia businesses?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we provide commercial Starlink installation throughout the Northern Virginia business community, from tech companies in the Dulles corridor to retail establishments in Alexandria and Arlington. Our business installations include enhanced mounting options, professional cable management, and network integration services.</p>
